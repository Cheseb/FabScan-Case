To make use of these files you will need a 3D printer.

I printed the parts in RED ABS from ridgid ink at 235 deg C, with a bedtemp 110 deg C.

The dimensions are slightly larger than the measured dimensions because ABS shrinks as it cools.

The original laser for use with the fabscan is a class IIIa laser line. This laser is too powerfull
to use safely without risking damaging someones eyesight.

I substituted the laser in the original kit for this one


Line laser, red, 650nm, 90°, 5mW, Ø9x20mm, Laser Class 1, Focus fixed (1000mm), 
Cable length 100mm - 70104011

This is a class 1 laser line and is therefore safe to use in a homemade consumer product without
the risk of damaging sight permanetly and irrevesibly.

However the laser doesn't fit into the original turret so I designed and printed a new turret to
fit the laser on my 3D printer.

My turntable was also wobbly so I designed a 3D printed collar to make the turntable more stable.
I glued the turntable to the motor and turntable mount using slow setting epoxy resin.

You will note that I have built my fabscan back to front by accident, this was done by having the
base plate upside down when I began the build. 

You can generate new STL files by modifying the included OpenScad scripts if you bought a
different laser or motor.
